        If you're experiencing slow performance in Access Workspace, follow these troubleshooting steps:
        
        Step 1: Check Your Internet Connection
        - Run a speed test to verify your internet connection is stable and fast enough
        - Minimum recommended speed: 10Mbps download, 5Mbps upload
        - Try connecting to a different network if possible
        
        Step 2: Browser Troubleshooting
        - Clear your browser cache and cookies
        - Disable browser extensions that might interfere
        - Try using a different supported browser
        - Ensure your browser is updated to the latest version
        
        Step 3: Check System Resources
        - Close unnecessary applications to free up memory
        - Check if your device meets the minimum system requirements
        - Restart your computer to clear memory and temporary files
        
        Step 4: Application-Specific Checks
        - Reduce the date range for reports and data views
        - Simplify complex dashboards by removing widgets
        - Check if you're running resource-intensive processes (like month-end closing)
        
        Step 5: Contact Support
        If you've tried all the above steps and still experience slow performance:
        - Contact Access Support with details about the issue
        - Include information about when the problem occurs
        - Note any error messages you receive
        - Be prepared to share your browser console logs if requested
